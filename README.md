this # 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple web-based number guessing game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🔍 How It Works

- The computer randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**.
- The user enters a guess into the input box and clicks **Submit** (or presses **Enter**).
- The game responds with:
  - ✅ `Correct!` if the guess is right.
  - 🔼 `Too low! Try a higher number.` if the guess is too small.
  - 🔽 `Too high! Try a lower number.` if the guess is too big.
- The number of attempts is displayed after each guess.
- On correct guess, the game resets after 5 seconds.
